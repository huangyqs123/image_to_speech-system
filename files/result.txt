The terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland has been raised from substantial to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely.

The move, based on an EU intelligence assessment, follows a rise in militant republican activity, including a recent gun attack on a top police officer.

it oversaw a change in Northern Ireland's terror threat level last March - its first change for 12 years.

It was announced by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.

It, the UK's Security Service, is believed to review the threat level every six months. The terrorism threat level remains substantial in the rest of the UK,
meaning an attack is a strong possibility.
